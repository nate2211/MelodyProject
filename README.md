MelodyProject: Modular DAW & Audio Engine

MelodyProject is a lightweight, modular digital audio workstation (DAW) and audio processing engine built with Python, NumPy, and PyQt6. It features an "FL-Studio style" interface with a functional piano roll, polyphonic rendering, and a block-based architecture for instruments and effects.
🚀 Features
🎹 Advanced Piano Roll Interface

    Polyphonic Sequencing: Support for complex chords and overlapping notes across multiple octaves.

    Ghost Notes: Intelligent scale-aware shading to help you stay in key (Major, Minor, Pentatonic, Blues, and Modes).

    Smooth Playhead: Real-time playhead movement driven by high-resolution audio sample position.

    Visual Editing: Right-click to delete, drag to resize note length, and Alt+Click to set the start playback position.

🛠 Modular Block Architecture

The engine is built on a "Blocks" system where instruments and effects are interchangeable modules.

    Instruments: Includes synth_keys (PolyBLEP oscillators), guitar_pluck (Karplus-Strong physical modeling), and bell_fm.

    Effects (FX): Serial processing chains including Delay, Reverb (Schroeder-style), Transient Shapers, Biquad Filters (LP/HP/BP), and Soft Clipping.

    Humanization: Dedicated realism layers like piano_key_noise, piano_soundboard resonance, and piano_pedal_bloom to add acoustic life to synthetic sounds.

🎧 High-Fidelity Audio Engine

    NumPy-Powered: All DSP logic is vectorized in NumPy for high performance.

    Stateless Buffer Processing: Designed for stability and predictable rendering.

    Export Capabilities: Render your sequences directly to 16-bit 48kHz WAV files.

    Real-time Monitoring: Low-latency playback using sounddevice.

🏗 Project Structure

    gui.py: The main PyQt6 application logic and custom graphics views.

    pipeline.py: The core audio engine, sequencer logic, and track management.

    sounds.py: Implementation of primary instrument oscillators and basic FX.

    humanize.py & realism.py: Specialized DSP blocks for adding acoustic characteristics and "imperfections."

    main.py: Entry point for both CLI and GUI modes.

🧪 DSP Details
Karplus-Strong Synthesis

The guitar_pluck block uses a refined Karplus-Strong algorithm with a pick-transient exciter and a nonlinear string feedback loop to simulate physical string behavior.
PolyBLEP Oscillators

Synth oscillators use Polyphase Band-Limited Step (PolyBLEP) techniques to reduce aliasing, providing a cleaner sound at high frequencies compared to naive waveforms.
